## Project Introduction

The marine microbial ecosystem of the waters off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the Southern Ocean is inextricably tied to the season. Each spring brings forth a phytoplankton bloom and changes in the community composition of the bacteria and other microbes in the water. These microbes are the key players in the processes of biogeochemical cycling and carbon sequestration. The Southern Ocean has experienced dramatic warming due to the effects of anthropogenic climate change and the impact of climate change on the marine bacterial community is not fully understood. The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (PAL LTER) project has been collecting ecological data on the WAP since 1990, but detailed molecular data on this ecosystem is under sampled. Baseline measurements on the taxonomic makeup of the microbial community are needed for future research. Water samples from the surface water of the Western Antarctic Peninsula were collected by Dr. Shellie Bench at Palmer Station, over the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 summer seasons. This project is focused on the 15 different 16S rRNA V4 amplicon libraries generated from the sequencing of these water samples. With this data, a metagenomic analysis can help reveal the pattern of changes in the community composition of bacteria that are associated to the phytoplankton blooms off the coast of the Western Antarctic Peninsula

## Primary Files

./Palmer_Station_Metadata contains the environmental data from Palmer Station Sample Site B.

./R contains the R script of the metagenomic analysis of the 16S samples. It also contains the rendered Rmarkdown html file.

./metadata contains the metadata files required for QIIME2 and the R analysis.

./qiime2 contains the main QIIME2 outputs required for the R analysis.

./scripts contains the primary bash script used to process the 16S reads on the SJSU CoS HPC.
